Associativity usually improves the hit ratio, but not always. Consider a direct mapped cache with 16 1-word blocks
and a 2-way set-associative cache with 1-word block size and a total size of 16 words. Find a sequence of memory references
for which the associative cache experiences more misses than the direct mapped cache.

Access block 0, then block 8, then block 16, then block 0, then block 8
Assume that in direct mapped block 0 and 16 are mapped on the same set and block 8 is a different set (modulo 16).
Assume that in associativity mapped block 0, 8 and 16 can be mapped on two possible sets.
Use LRU as policy to decide which block to evict.

Direct mapped: Miss, miss, miss, miss, hit
Associativity mapped: Miss, miss, miss, miss, miss
