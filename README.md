Computer Architecture and Design
================================

### Requirements
- C compiler ([gcc](https://gcc.gnu.org/))
- RISC-V simulator ([RARS](https://github.com/TheThirdOne/rars))

These exercises were made during the "[Computer Architecture & Design (H01P5A)](https://onderwijsaanbod.kuleuven.be/syllabi/v/e/H01P5AE.htm#activetab=doelstellingen_idp3881280)" exercise sessions at KU Leuven in the fall of 2020. RISC-V is used as the assembly language, while C serves as a higher level programming language. A lot of exercises are based on the book of Patterson & Hennessy: "Computer Organisation and Design RISC-V Edition (1st Ed.)".

The exercises sessions are classified as follows:
- Session 1: Introduction to C
- Session 2: Introduction to RISC-V
- Session 3: Using the stack and functions in RISC-V
- Session 4: Implementation of pointers and using the heap in RISC-V
- Session 5: Operating system calls in RISC-V
- Session 6: Implement a linked list in C and RISC-V
- Session 7: Hardware implementation of caches
- Session 8: Performance improvements in RISC-V
