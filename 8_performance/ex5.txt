The code below describes a simple function in RISC-V assembly.
    1 or t1, t2, t3
    2 or t2, t1, t4
    3 or t1, t1, t2
Assume the following cycle times for each of the options related to forwarding;
Without forwarding:250ps
With Full Forwarding:300ps

Exercise 5.1: Indicate the dependencies and their type: Read After Write (RAW), Write After Read (WAR), Write after Write (WAW).
- RAW on t1 from I1 to I2 and I3
- RAW on t2 from I2 to I3
- WAR on t2 from I1 to I2
- WAR on t1 from I2 to I3
- WAW on t1 from I1 to I3
