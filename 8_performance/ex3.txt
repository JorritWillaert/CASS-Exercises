In this exercise we examine how pipelining affects the clock cycle time of the processor. Problems in
this exercise assume that individual stages of the datapaths a and b have the following latencies:
    IF      ID      EX      MEM     WB
a   300ps   400ps   350ps   500ps   100ps
b   200ps   150ps   120ps   190ps   140ps

Exercise 3.1: What is the clock cycle time in a pipelined and single-cycle non-pipelined processor?
- Datapath a: clock cycle time in a single-cycle non-pipelined processor = 300ps + 400ps + 350ps + 500ps + 100ps = 1650ps
- Datapath b: clock cycle time in a single-cycle non-pipelined processor = 200ps + 150ps + 120ps + 190ps + 140ps = 800ps

- Datapath a: clock cycle time in a pipelined processor = latency of longest stage = 500ps
- Datapath b: clock cycle time in a pipelined processor = latency of longest stage = 200ps

Exercise 3.2: What is the total latency of a lw instruction in a pipelined and single-cycle non-pipelined processor?
- Datapath a: latency in a single-cycle non-pipelined processor = latency in a pipelined processor = 1650ps
- Datapath b: latency in a single-cycle non-pipelined processor = latency in a pipelined processor = 800ps

Exercise 3.3: If we can split one stage of the pipelined datapath into two new stages, each with half the latency of the original stage,
which stage would you split and what is the new clock cycle time of the processor?
Split the longest stage.
- Datapath a: split the MEM stage --> New clock cycle time in a pipelined processor = 400ps
- Datapath b: split the IF stage --> New clock cycle time in a pipelined processor = 190ps
