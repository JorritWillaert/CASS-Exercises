Allocating dynamic memory on the stack is not possible.

1) The sp register is callee-save, so the allocate_stack function breaks calling convention
2) That also means that when you call allocate_stack, your function will break calling convention if it doesn't restore the stack pointer
3) If you do restore the stack pointer, you are also deallocating dynamic memory that has been
reserved in this function.

In theory, yes, you can allocate on the stack. But then the allocated dynamic memory can never
live longer than the function itself, since you need to restore the stack pointer (deallocate the meory) before returning in order for the call stack to function correctly.

That makes a simple function such as the stack_create or stack_push from previous exercises impossible to write. They simply can't return addresses to newly allocated stack space - it has to be deallocated first!
